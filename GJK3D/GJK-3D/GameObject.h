Description:
This is a Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi test. (Called GJK for short.) This is in 3D.
Contains two cubes, one that is stationary and one that is moving. They are bounded
by OBBs (Object-Oriented Bounding Boxes) and when these OBBs collide the moving object
"bounces" on the x axis (because that is the only direction the object is moving).
The algorithm will detect any axis of collision, but will not output the axis that was
collided (because it doesn't know). Thus, we assume x and hardcode in the x axis bounce.
There is a physics timestep such that every update runs at the same delta time, regardless
of how fast or slow the computer is running. The cubes would be the exact same as their OBBs,
since they are aligned on the same axis.
